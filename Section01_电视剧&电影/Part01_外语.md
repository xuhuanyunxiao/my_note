# 第一部 豪斯医生 House

## 经典台词

Dan’s Mother: How can you just sit there?my son is going to die 
House: If I eat standing up, I spill. 
如果我站着吃东西,就会洒出来. 

Luke: Is this a good hospital? 
House: Depends on what you mean by "good". I like the chairs. 

Dr. Foreman: Isn’t treating patients why we became doctors? 
House: No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors. Treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable. 

Dr. Wilson: I love my wife. 我爱我老婆
House: You certainly love saying it. 当然，你爱这样说。

患者说他可以和上帝对话,然后house说他的问题应该在他的脑袋上. 
chase说,这只是宗教信仰 
house:you talk to God,you’re religious.God talks to you,you’re psychotic. 

House: People don’t want a sick doctor. 
Dr. Wilson: That’s fair enough, I don’t like healthy patients. 

Dr. Wilson: You will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want, but you’re incapable of kissing a little ass? 
你为了得到你要的结果可以坑蒙拐骗,无所不用,怎么就不能稍稍拍拍马屁呢? 
House: Well, we all have our limitations. 

House: No, there is not a thin line between love and hate. There is a Great Wall of China with armed sentries posted every 20’ between love and hate. 爱与恨并非只有一线之隔,爱与恨之间隔着一道十步一岗,五步一哨的中国长城.

Dr. Wilson: I’m still amazed you’re in the same room as a patient. 
真令我惊讶,你居然还和患者呆在一间屋子里.
House: People don’tbother me until they get teeth. 

House: As long as you’re trying to be good, you can do whatever you want. 
Dr. Wilson: And as long as you’re not trying, you can say whatever you want. 
House: So between us, we can do whatever we want. We can rule the world! 

House: So what’s her name and when do I get to meet her?
她的名字叫什么,我什么时候能见到她?(盘问Wilson的约会对象)
Dr. Wilson: There’s nobody! Give it up!
House: Your lips say no, but your shoes say yes.
你嘴上说不,可你的鞋子泄露了真相(WILSON换了双漂亮的新鞋)
Dr. Wilson: They’re French. You can’t trust a word they say.

Dr. Foreman: Why are you riding on me?
你为什么对我这么刻薄?
House: It’s what I do. Has it gotten worse lately?
我就是这样子,最近我变得更厉害了吗?
Dr. Foreman: Yeah. Seems to me.对我来说是的.
House: Really? Well, that rules out the race thing. You were just as black las week.

House: What would you prefer - a doctor who holds your hand while you die or who ignores you while you get better? I guess it would particularly suck to have a doctor who ignores you while you die.

Dr. Foreman: The kid was just taking his AP calculus exam when all of a sudden he got nauseous and disoriented. 这个孩子在微积分考试当中突然感到恶心晕.
House: That’s the way calculus presents.当然这是微积分的作用啦

House: I assume "minimal at best" is your stiff upper lip British way of saying "no chance in hell"? 我认为你说的"有可能"就是"根本没指望了"的英国表达方式.
Dr. Chase: I’m Australian.
House: You put the Queen on your money. You’re British.

Dr. Chase: You’re going to talk to a patient?
House: God talks to him. It’d be arrogant of me to assume I’m better than God.

Ronald: I assume House is a great doctor?
Dr. Chase: Why would you assume that?
Ronald: Because if you’re that big a jerk you’re either great or unemployed.

You spend your whole life looking for answers,because you think the next answer would change something.Maybe make you a little less miserable. And you know that when you run out of questions you don’t just run out of answers.You run out of hope. 
你用整个人生去寻找答案，希望下一个答案能够改变一切，让你没那么悲惨。 你也知道，当你再也问不出问题， 找不到答案的时候，你就失去了希望。

Julia: I thought you were supposed to be listening to our patient histories?
我认为你应该听我们讲解病史
House: No, I’m supposed to be teaching you. If I can do that without listening to you, more power to me.

Dr. Cameron: Yeah, I I trusted you.
House: You always trust me. That’s a big mistake.

House: I take risks - sometimes patients die. But not taking risks causes more patients to die. So I guess my biggest problem is I’ve been cursed with the ability to do the math.

Dr. Cuddy: Answer me.
House: Nothing I could say is going to change how you feel, and nothing could come out of your reaction that is going to change what I plan to do. So I prefer to say nothing.

Dr. Foreman: You know, House shouldn’t even be here!
Dr. Chase: Because he said something inappropriate? If we sent him home every time he did that, he’d never be here. We wouldn’t even need his office.

Dr. Cameron: I was the first person (House) ran into. He just asked me.
Dr. Chase: Yeah, like a date.
Dr. Cameron: Exactly. Except for the “date” part.

House: But I had three reasons.
Dr. Cuddy: Good ones?
House: Well, lets see in a minute - I’m just making them up now.
BLAH BLAH BLAH.....(CUDDY没买帐)
House: Which brings me to my fourth reason.
Dr. Cuddy: I thought you said there were only three?
House: I thought you’d buy one of them.

Dr. Wilson: Who?
House: Kevin. In Bookkeeping.
Dr. Wilson: Okay, well first of all, his name is Carl.
House: I call him Kevin. It’s his secret friendship club name.

Dr. Wilson: How do you know she needs a heart transplant?
House: I got my aura read today. It said someone close to me had a broken heart.
我看了占卜书,上面说今天有个人会心碎.

Dr. Wilson: You lied, didn’t you?
House: I never lie.
Dr. Wilson: Big mistake.

Lola: You have a big "keep out’ sign stapled on your forehead.
你满脸的不乐意,就差在你头上贴块"别理我"的牌子了.
House: That explains it. I told them to put it on my door.

Dr. Cameron: I don’t have the right to show interest in someone?
Dr. Forman: You absolutely do. And I absolutely have the right to humiliate you for it.

House: You were pregnant. Based on your hormone levels, you had a miscarriage.
你怀孕了,从你的激素水平看,你刚刚自然流产了.
Sarah: I haven’t even been on a date.
House: Right, since it’s physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner.
好吧,显然没人请你吃饭的话你是无法和人做爱的.
Sarah: I haven’t had sex since I split up with my husband.That was almost a year ago.
House: Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception.
好吧,你是第二个圣母玛利亚
Sarah: Um, what do I do?
House: Well, it’s obvious. Start a religion

House: Someday there will be a black president. Someday there will be a gay president. Maybe there’ll even be a gay black president. But one combination I do not see is gay, black, and dead.
有一天我们会有一位黑人总统,有一天我们会有一位同性恋总统,也许有一天我们会有一位黑人同性恋总统,但是肯定不会有个既是同性恋,又是黑人,还是死人的总统.

House: Take these, go home, talk to your daughter.
Female Patient: What?
House: Your pants, your blouse, your scarf are all freshly dry cleaned. Everything except your jacket, it’s got a smudge on it. Probably two days old. Which means you didn’t know the jacket had been worn. So either your husband is a crossdresser or your daughter has been borrowing your clothes without telling you. Probably wants to look older to get into bars.
你的裤子,衬衫,围巾都是刚刚干洗过的,只有你的外套上面有块污迹,也许有两天了.这说明你没发现它被人穿过,所以要么是你丈夫有变装癖,要么就是你女儿偷偷穿了你衣服出去,好装扮得成熟点去混进酒吧.
Female Patient: I don’t have a daughter.

House: We’re missing something.
Dr. Chase: What?
House: If I knew that it wouldn’t be missing.

House: You Jewish?
Dr. Gilmar: Yeah.
House: Is it true what they say about Jewish foreplay?
Dr. Gilmar: Two hours of begging?
House: I heard four.
Dr. Gilmar: Well actually I’m only half-Jewish.

House: (about a lecture) I’m not doing it. (leaves, then stops) You’re supposed to stop me. Renegotiate.
Dr. Cuddy: Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.

House: (walking away from the class) Can you still hear me?
Rebellious Student: No.
Caring Student: A little.
Keen Student: Not really.
House: If you can’t hear me, how do you know what I asked?

Dr. Cameron: Who (thinks he’s sick)?
House: His wife.
Dr. Cameron: The woman you used to live with.
House: That’s her Indian name. On her driver’s license it’s "Stacy."

Dr. Cameron: Black defendants are ten times more likely to get a death sentence then white.
黑人罪犯被判死刑的比率是白人的十倍.
Dr. Foreman: Doesn’t mean we need to get rid of the death penalty – we just need to kill more white people.
那不意味着我们需要禁止死刑-我们只要杀掉更多的白人就行了.

Dr. Chase: If she’s never kissed a boy, it’s a fair bet she’s never had sex.
如果她从来没有接过吻,那她就应该没有做过爱
House: Tell that to all the hookers who won’t kiss me on the mouth.
和那些不愿和我接吻的妓女说这话吧.

Dr. Chase: She’s had one hallucination. Why are we operating on her? Why are we risking her life?
她只是有幻觉症状,为什么我们冒生命的危险要给她动手术
House: Because Wilson thinks it would be nice to give the girl a year to say goodbye to her mommy. I guess maybe she stutters or something.
因为WILSON希望能多给她一年时间,好让她和她母亲说再见,我估计她有口吃的毛病.

House: I should have been out of here 20 minutes ago.
我20分钟前就应该离开这了
Nurse Brenda: You got here 20 minutes ago.
你到这刚20分钟

Dr. Foreman: You have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis.

Dr. Cameron: Why would you need $5,000?
为什么你需要5000＄？
Dr. Chase: Bad night at poker or great night with a hooker.
糟糕的扑克之夜，或者美好的妓女之夜
House: Thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke.
感谢你用笑话把我从个人隐私问题里拯救出来

Dr. Wilson: If you have the money then why did you need the loan?
如果你有钱的话为什么还要向我借?
House: I didn’t. I just wanted to see if you’d give it to me. I’ve been borrowing increasing amounts ever since you lent me $40 a year ago. Ummm, a little experiment to see where you’d draw the line.
我就想看看你会不会借给我,自从一年前我找你借过40元后,我每次都增加借钱的数量,就想实验一下你的底线在哪里
Dr. Wilson: You’re…you’re trying to objectively measure how much I value our friendship.
你...你用钱来衡量我们的友谊?
House: It’s five grand – you got nothing to be ashamed of.
5千块啊,你没什么好羞耻的.
Dr. Wilson: Now, be a grown-up and either tell Mommy and Daddy you don’t want to see them, or I’m picking you up at seven for dinner.
你要么成熟点自己去告诉你爸妈你不想见他们,要么我就7点来接你吃晚饭.
House: What do you mean? You just said…?
什么意思？你刚才不是说...
Dr. Wilson: I lied. I’ve been lying to you in increasing amounts ever since I told you you looked good unshaved a year ago. It’s a little experiment, you know, to see where you’d draw the line.

House: How’s your recovery going? Got around to the small muscles yet?

Mark Warner: It’s not the size of the muscle – it’s where you get to put it.(成人级笑话,看不懂的也别去问了)
不但有肌肉，还经常去它该去的地方
Stacy: My goodness, it’s like watching Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward in the third grade.
天哪，我好像是在剧院里看两个小丑

Stacy: You have been hiding things and lying to me all day.

错，我们成为医生的理由是治病，而治人使得大多数的医生痛苦万分。
Foreman: So you’re trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine.
所以你决定把人性从医生的使命中排除掉。
House: If you don’t talk to them they can’t lie to us, and we can’t lie to them. Humanity is overrated.
如果我们不同病人交流，他们就骗不了我们，当然我们也骗不了他们，谈人性在这里太过了。

# 第二部 疑犯追踪 Person of Interest

## 经典台词

We're not walking in the dark.We are thedark.

Even the blackest heart still beats.

A good friend once showed me that,even with an intractable problem,one can still find a way to do the right thing.

Everyone dies alone.but if you mean something to someone,if you help someone or love someone.if even a single person remembers you.then maybe you never really die at all.

Sooner or later,you're gonna have to trust someone.

Human life is ephemera,which makes it precious.
人类的生命因其短暂，才弥足珍贵。

No matter who they become or where they hide, there will always be the people they meet, the people they love, the people they wrong.

Veni Vedi Vici. —— ——Caesar    我至，我见，我征服。
Invictus Maneo.     我战无不胜。

That's one of the things you learn over there--In the end, we're all alone. And no one's coming to save you.

When you find that one person who connects you to the world, you become someone different, someone better. When that person is taken from you... what do you become then?

I don't have anything care about.Before I found you

Some of us don't get old with the one we love,but I will,just fromafar.
我们会白头偕老，只是天各一方。

π The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter
π 圆周长与其直径之比
And this is just the beginning
Forever
Without ever repeating
Which means that contained within this string of decimals
Is every single other number
Your birth date
Combination to your locker
Your social security number
It’s all in there somewhere
And if you convert these decimals into letters
You would have every word that ever existed
In every possible combination
The first syllable you spoke as a baby
The name of your latest crush
Your entire life story from beginning to end
Everything we ever say or do
All of the world’s infinite possibilities rest
Within this one simple circle
Now what you do with that information
What it’s good for
Well, that would be up to you

Well, it wasn't enough time, Michael. It wasn't enough time.

我从来没有想过要带给你这些。我工作了一辈子，来养家糊口，我没有道过歉，我不愿意当个傻瓜，可我总是在大人物所牵的绳子上跳舞。我不会道歉的，这就是我的本色，不过我也想到过那一点，我想那时候是你的天下，你就是牵绳子的那个人。考利昂参议员，考利昂州长。好了，时间不多了，迈克尔。时间不多了！

有些事必须干，你干就是了，绝不高谈阔论。不要去判断要做的这些事是否合理。它们没法判断。你干你的就是了，干完之后就忘记。

Life is so beautiful ……

生命是如此的美丽……（教父临终语）



**教父的FAVOR**

He (Don Corleone) had long ago learned that society imposes insults that must be borne, comforted by the knowledge that in this world there comes a time when the most humble of men, if he keeps his eye open, can take his revenge on the most powerful. It was this knowledge that prevented the Don from losing the humility all his friends admired in him.

​     他（柯里昂教父）早就懂得：社会上常常会有突如其来的侮辱，那是必须忍受的。在这个世界上，常常会出现这样的情况：最微不足道的人，如果他时刻留意的话，总会有机会向那些最不可一世的人报仇血恨。明白了这个道理，也就心平气和了。正是因为明白这个道理，老头子才从来不丧失那种他所有朋友都叹服的谦虚谨慎的作风。

PS: Any profession was worthy of respect to men who for centuries earned bread by the sweat of their brows.

 千百年来，只要凭卖力气，流汗水换饭吃，任何职业都是值得尊敬的。

​    

The Don always taught that when a man was generous, he must show the generosity as personal. He gave the baker a Di Nobili cigar and a glass of yellow Strega and put his hand on the men’s shoulder to urge him on. That was the mark of the Don’s humanity. He knew from bitter experience what courage it took to ask a favor from a fellow man.

​    柯里昂教父经常这样教导：如果一个人要慷慨，那他就必须把这种慷慨表现得充满感情。

他递给面包师傅一根“高贵牌”雪茄烟，一杯“振奋牌”果子露，还把手搭在他的肩膀上鼓励他说下去，这就是老头子的人情味的一种表示。他从自己辛酸的经历中体会到：大家同样是人，要一个人央求另一个人办一件事，这可需要多大的勇气啊。

PS:  If a person is very generous, then he must behave himself an emotional generosity.

 

“You know those Arctic explorers who leave caches of food scattered on the route to the North Pole? Just in case they may need them someday? That’s my father’s favors. Someday he’ll be at each one of those people’s houses and they had better come across.”

​     “你知道北极探险家在去北极的路上，沿途总要把食物在地窖里埋起来吗？就是为了预防有一天走到那里可能需要食物。这就是我父亲为别人做好事的道理。他有一天也可能有事相求，要登门拜访他们。所以最好他们能先过来拜访下我们。”

 

The Don helped those in misfortune whose misfortune he had partly created. Not perhaps out of cunning or planning but because of his variety of interests or perhaps because of the nature of the universe, the interlinking of good and evil, natural of itself.

​     柯里昂教父一方面在帮助那些陷于不幸的人们，但另一方面那些人的不幸一定程度上却是他造成的。这，既不是出于阴谋诡计，也不是出于刻意安排，而是由于他利益的多样性，或者说是宇宙的自然法则，善与恶的相互渗透乃是自然本身的法则。（所以说，强大你自身，是保护自己的终极之道。）

 

**对敌理念**

 

Don’t hate your enemy, or you will make wrong judgment.

不要憎恨你的敌人，否则你将做出错误的判断。

 

Never tell anybody outside the family what you’re thinking again.

（这句话是教父对其大儿子Sonny的训斥。Sonny在外人面前暴露出与父亲不同的想法，终酿成大祸，招致敌人对老一代教父的暗杀行动。Corleone家族也正是由此从盛转衰。）

 

Sonny:

​     “If there’s one thing the old man hammered into me, it’s never to do a thing like that, to let other people know there’s a split of opinion in the Family.”

​     “如果说老爸对我有什么教导，使我永远不忘的话，那就是永远不能做一件蠢事：让外人知道我们家族内部有意见分歧。”

 

Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

离你的朋友近些，但离你的敌人要更近，这样你才能更了解他

 

Don’t let anybody know what you are thinking.

不要让任何人知道你在想什么（迈克对文森说）。

 

Don’t let women dictate your actions and they’re not competent in this world, though certainly they’ll be saint in heaven while we men burn in hell.

不要让女人左右你的行为。而她们在这个世界上并没有这样的资格，尽管可以肯定她们会上天堂。当圣人，而男人要下地狱，受火烧。

 

**教父的自信**

 

I’m gonna make him an offer he can’t refuse.

我将给他一个他无法拒绝的理由/条件。

（这局可称是教父系列中最经典的一句台词。敢这样说，来源于强大的自信，是一个男人对自己力量和谋略的笃信。）

 

He never asks a second favor when he’s been refused the first.

小说里的原句。

 

My father assured him that either his brains or his signature would be on the contract.

 

You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I forgot the vengeance of my son…..but I ‘m a superstitious man. And if some unlucky accident should befall him—if he should get shot in the head by a police officer or if he should hang himself in the jail cell or if he’s struck by a bolt of lightning—then I’m gonna blame some of the people in this room. And that I do not forgive.

我是个迷信的人,若是他不幸发生意外,或被警察开枪打死,或在牢里上吊,或是他被闪电击中,那我会怪罪这个房间里的每一个人,到那时候我就不会再客气了。

 

**教父对待家人的态度**

 

Do you spend time with your family? Good. Because a man that doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man.

你经常跟家人呆在一起吗？不错。因为不经常与家人呆在一起的男人，永远也成不了真正的男人！

 

I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless. But not men.

我费了一生的精力，试图不让自己变得十分粗心。女人和小孩子们可以很粗心，但男人不会。

 

Everything I do with my power, including something criminal, I just want to protect my family and my friends .

我以我的力量所做的一切事情，包括一些罪恶，只是为了保护我的家人和我的朋友。

 

I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life — I don't apologize — to take care of my family, and I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those big shots. I don't apologize — that's my life — but I thought that, that when it was your time, that you would be the one to hold the string. Senator Corleone; Governor Corleone. Well, it wasn't enough time, Michael. It wasn't enough time.

我从来没有想过要带给你这些。我工作了一辈子，来养家糊口，我没有道过歉，我不愿意当个傻瓜，做那些大人物手中的提线木偶。我毫无歉意，这就是我的命运，不过我也想到过，到时候我儿子成为真正的男人时，你就要做手握绳子的那个人。科利翁尼参议员，科利翁尼州长。好了，时间不多了，迈克尔。时间不多了！

 

**教父的友谊观**

Friendship can build a solid defense.

友谊可以筑起一道坚实的防线。

 

The Don to Bonasera:

​     “My feelings were wounded but I am not that sort of person who thrusts his friendship on those who do not value it——on those who think me of little account.

“我伤了感情了，但是我这个人并不把自己的友谊强加于那些不重视友谊的人——那些认为我无足轻重的人。”



 The Don to Jonny:

​     “Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than government; it is almost the equal of family. Never forget that. If you had built up a wall of friendships you wouldn’t have to ask me to help.”

​     “友谊就是一切。友谊比天赋还重要。朋友比政府还重要。朋友简直等于自家人，永远不要忘记这一点。如果你用朋友的友谊筑起一道防线，你也就不会相求于你的教父了。”



 

**迈克的顿悟**

[中英整理版" title="《教父》经典语录 中英整理版" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; list-style: none; width: 518px; height: 362px;">](http://photo.blog.sina.com.cn/showpic.html#blogid=6930b877010146zk&url=http://s1.sinaimg.cn/orignal/6930b877nc62c65fcccd0)

 

After five months of exile in Sicily, Michael Corleone came finally to understand his father’s character and his destiny. He came to understand men like Luca Brasi, the ruthless caporegime Clemenza, his mother’s resignation and acceptance of her role. For in Sicily he saw what they would have been if they had chosen not to struggle against their fate. He understood why the Don always said, “A man has only one destiny.” 

迈克·柯里昂在西西里过了五个月的流浪生活之后，终于真正懂得了他父亲的性格和他自己的命运。他终于真正懂得了像路加·布瑞西和冷酷的克莱门扎这类人物，也懂得了他母亲那种安分守己的超然态度。在西西里，他看的一清二楚，要是他们不行动起来同自己的命运作斗争，他们将落得什么下场？他懂得了，为什么老头子反反复复地说：“一个人只有一种命运。”（这段话出自原版，很完整地解释了A man has only one destiny的原因。不抗争，便只能像蝼蚁一样的活着，不满也不甘，奋斗的原动力，促使着你向上爬，变得更强更有力，完成你在这个世界上的使命。）

 

Michael Corleone understood for the first time why men like his father chose to become thieves and murderers rather than members of the legal society. The poverty and fear and degradation were too awful to be acceptable to any man of spirit. 

迈克·柯里昂破天荒地第一次悟出一个道理，为什么像他父亲那样的人，甘愿当盗窃犯和谋杀犯而不愿意当合法社会的守法公民？贫穷，恐惧，屈辱，这些东西太可怕了，对任何一个有骨气的人来说，都是难以忍受的。

 

If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.

如果生活告诉了我们什么，历史教育了我们什么，那就是你可以杀了任何人。（还能记得迈克说这句话时自负的神情和语气。迈克是个有仇必报的人，不管是性格还是为了家庭生存的原因，他总是把仇人翦除殆尽。）

Only don’t tell me you’re innocent. It insults my intelligence, makes me very angry.

（迈克只想知道是不是妹夫参与陷害了哥哥。之前所有的承诺，什么一笔勾销，拉斯维加斯旅行，我是你孩子的教父，所有一切是诱饵，是放松警惕的“后路”。可怜以劳尔的智商会信以为真，他不了解迈克是什么样的人。犯下这样不可饶恕的罪过，只有一条后路，那就是死。）

 

See, all our people are businessmen. Their loyalty is based on that. One thing I learned from Pop was trying to think as people around you think. On that basis, anything is possible.

看，与我们打交道的都是生意人。他们忠诚是建立在利益至上的。我从爸爸那里学到的一点，那就是揣摩周围人的想法，以他们的立场去思考。在生意的基础上，一切皆有可能。

 

You make the choice, and this is your price.

你做出了这个决定，这是你的代价。

（这句是《教父3》里最经典的一句话。）

 

All my life, I, kept trying to go up in society where everything higher up was legal, straight. But the higher I go, the crookeder it becomes. How in the hell does it end?

（我一生都费尽心思地向上攀爬。之前我认为上层的世界合法、磊落。可越往上攀爬，越觉险恶。这没完没了的勾心斗角、争执倾轧，什么时候才是个头？）

 

**其他**

 

Tom to Michael:

There are things that have to be done and you do them and you never talk about them. You don’t try to justify them. They can’t be justified. You just do them. Then you forget it.”

有些事必须干，你干就是了，绝不高谈阔论。不要去判断要做的这些事是否合理。它们没法判断。你干你的就是了，干完之后就忘记。

 

In Hagen’s world, the Corlenone’s world, the physical beauty, the sexual power of women, carried not the slightest weight in worldly matters. It was a private affair, except, of course, in matters of marriage and family disgrace.

​     在黑根（Hagen即家族参谋Tom Hagen)眼里，在柯里昂家族眼里，女人的肉体美，女人的性魅力，在人情世故中是无足轻重的私人小事，当然，除非涉及到婚姻和家庭荣辱。

 

Great men are not born great, they grow great, and so it was with Vito Corleone.

 伟人并非生来就伟大的，而是在其成长过程中体现其伟大的，维托·柯里昂也同样如此。

 

Tessio had a better opinion of Michael. He sensed something else in the young man: a force cleverly kept hidden, a man jealously guarding his true strength from public gaze, following the Don’s precept that a friend should always underestimate your virtues and an enemy overestimate your faults.

 忒希奥对迈克比较有好感。他在这个年轻人身上感到了另一种气质：平时不露锋芒，生怕把自己的实力公开在光天化日之下；紧守柯里昂教父的训诲：让朋友低估你的优点，让敌人高估你的缺点。（对于为成熟的雏鸟，第一任务，亮出你的锋芒，有了之后才是学习隐藏之时。）

 

“Revenge is a dish that tastes best when it is cold.”

复仇是一道冷却后味道才最好的菜肴。（剌开肚子的那一刀）

 

He (Albert Nerl) was rarely tactful. If he disagreed with a group’s attitude or an individual’s opinion, he kept his mouth shut or brutally spoke his contradiction. He never gave a polite agreement.

他（亚伯特·奈尔，在电影末尾枪杀巴茨尼的身穿警察制服的人）表现得罕见的老练。要是他不同意一群人的态度或个别人的意见，他要么守口如瓶，要么和盘托出自己反对的理由。他向来都不表示礼节性的同意。

 

It’s not personal,it’s business.

不要把私人的感情带到商界，这不利于发展，即使有解决不了的，靠你的能力，你的智慧来解决。（感情和事业两分，这是最健康的关系。）

 

It was part of the Don’s greatness that he profited from everything.

 老头子的伟大，其中部分原因就是因为他从每一件事情里都得到了好处。
